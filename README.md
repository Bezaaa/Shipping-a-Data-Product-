readme_content = """# Kara Solutions: Ethiopian Medical Business Data Platform

## Project Overview

This project builds a data platform to extract, transform, and analyze Telegram data related to Ethiopian medical businesses. It enables insights such as:

- Top mentioned medical products or drugs
- Price and availability differences across channels
- Visual content analysis via object detection on images
- Posting trends over time for health topics

The project implements a modern ELT pipeline with these stages:

- **Extract:** Scrape Telegram messages and images
- **Load:** Store raw data in a data lake and load into PostgreSQL
- **Transform:** Clean and model data using dbt in a star schema format
- **Enrich:** Detect objects in images using YOLOv8 and enrich the data
- **Expose:** Serve analytical insights via FastAPI endpoints
- **Orchestrate:** Automate and schedule pipeline runs with Dagster

Keep your .env file secure and out of version control.

The scraper handles Telegram rate limits but avoid excessive scraping.

Manual SQL model execution is possible if dbt CLI isn’t available.

Docker setup is provided for environment consistency.
